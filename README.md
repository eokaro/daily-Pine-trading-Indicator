Daily AI Trading Assistant – PineScript Strategy

This project is a cost-effective daily AI trading assistant built entirely in TradingView’s Pine Script. It leverages a combination of technical indicators—Exponential Moving Averages (EMAs), the Relative Strength Index (RSI), volume analysis, and a custom 3-minute high filter—to generate buy and sell signals. The goal is to provide an easy-to-deploy, no-cost strategy for traders who want to take advantage of algorithmic trading signals without investing in expensive data feeds or cloud infrastructure.

Key Features:

Trend Detection:
Uses the 9 EMA and 20 EMA crossover to capture trend shifts. A bullish crossover signals a potential entry, while a bearish crossover indicates an exit or short signal.

Momentum Confirmation:
Incorporates a 14-period RSI to ensure trades are taken with sufficient momentum. Buy signals require RSI values above 50, and sell signals occur when RSI drops below 50.

Volume Analysis:
Validates signals by checking that the current volume exceeds the 20-bar moving average by a set threshold, ensuring that signals are supported by market strength.

3-Minute High Filter:
Adds an extra layer of confirmation by requiring that the current bar’s high equals the highest high of the last three bars. This filter helps confirm that the price is breaking out with strength.

Alert Integration:
Built-in TradingView alert conditions allow you to receive real-time notifications. You can also integrate these alerts with webhook services for automated trading actions if desired.

Usage Instructions:

Copy & Paste:
Open TradingView’s Pine Script Editor, paste the provided code, and add it to your chart.

Customize Alerts:

Deploy & Monitor:
Once the strategy is active on your chart, monitor the signals and adjust parameters as needed based on your trading style and market conditions.
